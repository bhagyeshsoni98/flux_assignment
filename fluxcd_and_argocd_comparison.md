| Installation/Bootstrapping                                                                               | The Flux installation/bootstrapping mechanism can be done together, and it is the recommended way to get started. During bootstrapping, Flux creates a repository on GitHub or GitLab (a generic “git” mode can also be used), then creates all the manifests for installation and connection to the repo in that same git repo. | Argo CD has no native mechanism for bootstrapping and is not opinionated about how it’s configured. The install is just that: the install of the Argo CD components via YAML manifests. |
| Reconciliation Configurability                                                                           | The Flux reconciliation loop can be configured at each component. Git repository can be checked every five minutes, but then be synced every 10 minutes. This gives you the ability to stagger how the reconciliation happens.                                                                                                   | Argo CD reconciliation is a global setting. This is one setting that can be modified via the Argo CD ConfigMap. Reconciliation time can not be set differently for each application.    |
| Application Delivery                                                                                     | Flux uses Kustomize heavily. Its Kustomize Controller renders and applies all the manifests that Flux syncs from the source repository, even when using raw Kubernetes YAML                                                                                                                                                      | Argo CD also supports Kustomize and raw Kubernetes YAML. It can, however, apply raw YAML files directly, without using Kustomize.                                                       |
| Web UI                                                                                                   | Flux, by itself, does not have a web UI. There are open source platforms like Weave GitOps Core that are based on Flux that have a UI.                                                                                                                                                                                           | Argo CD has a rich UI and was built with the UI.                                                                                                                                        |
| Secrets Management : Both Flux and Argo CD have mechanisms in place to handle the encrypting of secrets. | -                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | -                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Alerting and Notifications                                                                               | Flux provides a mechanism for alerting and outgoing notifications                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Argo CD uses Argo CD Notifications via its plugin mechanism.                                                                                                                            |
| Image Updates Automation                                                                                 | Flux has this concept with something called Image Update Automation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Argo CD has the Argo CD Image Updater                                                                                                                                                   |
